# FlappyAI
C++ &amp; OpenGL implementation of FlappyBird game with neural network learning to play it with generative algorithm

It uses simple neural network which takes x, y distance to pipe and y velocity of bird as an input and outputs 0 or 1 (jump or not)
Algorithm doesn't use crossover, but still converges pretty fast (about 20 generations)
